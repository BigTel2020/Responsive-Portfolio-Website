        <br>
        <p>I started my journey into Photography in 1981 in Sydney Australia. I purchased a Canon new F1 camera and learnt
            my craft with this Camera for 15 years eventually selling it in Darwin Northern Australia before the next
            chapter which was going to live in Thailand.<br> <p> Australia I did mainly portrait and commercial work moving to
            Thailand was where the Music production came in where I worked and played with numerous Thai bands for the 6
            years that I lived there.</p><br>I moved back to the UK in 2002 where I learnt Music production using Daw's such as
            Cubase, Nuendo, Wavelab, Ableton live and Sound forge.This then led me into Video Editing where I now use
            Davinci Resolve along with Premiere Pro, After Effects and Audition.<br>Now I have regained my Love for
            Photography once again and feel the circle is now complete, this chapter of my life is like a whole new
            beginning and I am excited with the challenge moving forward.</p>
